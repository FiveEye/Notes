## 1 Probability Theory

### 1.1 Set Theory

**Definition 1.1.1** The set, S, of all possible outcomes of a particular experiment is called the sample space for the experiment.

**Definition 1.1.2** An event is any collection of possible outcomes of an experiment, that is, any subset of S(including S itself).

**Definition 1.1.5** Two events $$A$$ and $$B$$ are disjoint if $$A \cap B = \emptyset$$. The events $$A_1, A_2, \dots$$ are pairwise disjoint if $$A_i \cap B_j = \emptyset$$ for all $$i \neq j$$.

**Definition 1.1.6** If $$A_1, A_2, \dots$$ are pairwise disjoint and $$\cup_{i=1}^
{\infty}A_i = S$$, then the collection $$A_1, A_2, \dots$$ forms a partition of $$S$$.
